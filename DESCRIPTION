Title: activesession (http://github.com/robertzk/activesession)
Description: Activesession provides a heterogeneous-backend key-value store syntax for R.
   This is a fancy way to say a list-like structure in which portions of the structure
   are loaded from a backend, such as the disk, a database, or a cloud storage service.
   This allows arbitrarily large memory objects to be used within the R console, as
   the local pieces that do not fit into memory can be purged on a least-recently-used
   basis. This is similar to the concept of views used by distributed version control
   systems.
